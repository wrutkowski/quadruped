Servos arrived. I tried to fit them to leg parts that I created several days ago as Iâ€™ve heard that cheap 9g servos can differ in sizes a bit. They were exactly the same size as my one old servo from previous project, so after some drilling and screwing first leg was ready.

I don't have a PWM Driver yet and I didn't want to put USB under too much draw from three servos so I decided to create a simple circuit with potentiometer and a button. I read the analog input from the potentiometer to set the servo angle and button switches between hip, thigh and tibia servos. All worked OK and the material was sturdy enough so I decided to create other 3 legs.

Mass production begins ðŸ˜„ It's just a quadruped, it's hard to imagine how repetitive it is for 6 or 8 leg robot.

And finally connected to the robot
