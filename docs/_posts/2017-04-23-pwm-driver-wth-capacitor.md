I bought 1000uF and 1500uF capacitors plus a few smaller to try it out. I had to unscrew the driver to solder capacitors.

It didn't helped for the shakes. **But** when measuring voltage of the capacitor connectors I saw a drop from 4.8V from 4 AA rechargeable batteries which were my power source to around 2.5V! That means the power source was too weak to handle that load. UBEC that I ordered hasn't arrived yet so I needed to wait. I was happier after this discovery.

When I visited the next door electronic shop I saw a spiral cable wrap or spiral cable tidy (name depends on the store) I bought crazy amount of 10 meters ðŸ™ƒ and I wrapped servo cables. It's neat now:
