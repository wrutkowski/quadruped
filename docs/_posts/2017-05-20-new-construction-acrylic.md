After trying to make balsa wood construction to work for a couple of times I decided I'll try shorter, more sturdy legs made from acrylic. I ordered 5 of those legs (one for a backup) from ebay.

I disassembled one leg and attached servos to the new acrylic parts.

It was a lot more sturdy than longer balsa construction so I followed the same steps for other legs.

Together with legs I ordered A4 sheet of 3mm acrylic to make a body. I cut 4 holes for servos and drilled several holes for screws for servos and pads for PWM Driver and on/off switch.

I adjusted body size and legs lengths settings in the code. Run calibration process again and without changing walk methods robot started walking for the first time! ðŸ˜„

It **was** worth switching to acrylic.
