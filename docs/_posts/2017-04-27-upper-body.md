While I wait for UBEC which will provide enough power for the servos I started working on enclosing for the robot. The requirement for it is to hold the display, ultrasonic sonar and RFID scanner. At the beginning I was thinking of creating a scaffolding to mount mentioned devices to but finally I designed a cuboid with one edge cut on 45¬∞.

The curved wall was meant to hold the display so it's easily readable when looking at the robot from the front.

After measuring the parts I started cutting balsa wood.

Piece with holes for ultrasonic sonar, display mounted on another piece.

RFID piece glued and the display from the other side. I checked whether RFID will work through 6mm balsa wood, but it is üëå

Everything glued together looks like this:

Inside:

Time to connect all wires. I stuck small breadboard with Arduino Nano on it next to PWM Driver, then I connected all devices using jumper wires and uploaded _emotions_ program to verify all works as expected.

I cut a hole for a power switch on the side and small holes for servo cables to go through. I mounted the upper body on the robot by glueing small fragments of one-by-one with holes for M3 screw.

It's tight inside, but there is enough room for UBEC and probably another Arduino if one is not enough to handle all tasks.

And with uploaded emotions program:

I'm still waiting for UBEC to arrive. When it will the robot should stand for the first time üëè
